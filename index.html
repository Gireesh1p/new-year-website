        <h2>About New year</h2>
        <div >
            <p>There have been celebrations to mark the beginning of a new year for thousands of years. <br>
                Sometimes these were simply an opportunity for people to eat, drink and have fun, <br> 
                but in some places the festivities were connected to the land or astronomical events. <br>
                For example, in Egypt the beginning of the year coincided with when the River Nile flooded, <br>
                and this normally happened when the star Sirius rose. <br>
                The Persians and Phoenicians started their new year at the spring equinox.</p>
